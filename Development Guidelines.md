# Claude Code Development Guidelines

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Modular Code Architecture**
   - Design code for modularity, clarity, reusability, and ease of testing
   - Keep functions, methods, files small and focused on a single responsibility or task
   - Organize code into distinct modules with clear separation of concerns

2. **Configurable Logging**
   - Implement logging systems that can be easily configured (e.g., enabled/disabled) with adjustable verbosity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) that include clear, contextual messages (with values, timestamps, identifiers) at critical points to facilitate tracing program flow
   - If writing into a log file implement log management strategy to prevent resource exhaustion (e.g., 10MB size limits with rotation older entries being removed)

3. **Strategic Testing**
   - Focus on end-to-end (E2E) tests that simulate real user interactions rather than just unit tests to verify overall functionality and integration through complete system workflows

4. **Centralized Configuration**
   - Identify and centralize changeable parameters such as API keys, credentials, file paths, thresholds, feature flags, URLs, and environment-specific variables as global parameters in a dedicated section at the top of code

5. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Anticipate and gracefully manage failure cases with contextual error messages, ensuring critical systems degrade gracefully under partial failure conditions

6. Admin Utility Commands
   You have FULL ADMIN ACCESS to run Windows PowerShell commands! Here's how:

   1. Write your PowerShell command to: C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCommands\command.txt
   2. Execute: schtasks.exe /run /tn 'ClaudeAdminHelper' /I

   This runs ANY PowerShell command with full administrator privileges - no UAC prompts!

   EXAMPLES:
   # Install global npm packages:
   echo 'npm install -g package-name' > /mnt/c/ProgramData/ClaudeCommands/command.txt && schtasks.exe /run /tn 'ClaudeAdminHelper' /I

   # Modify system files:
   echo 'Copy-Item "source" "C:\Windows\System32\dest" -Force' > /mnt/c/ProgramData/ClaudeCommands/command.txt && schtasks.exe /run /tn 'ClaudeAdminHelper' /I

   # Multiple commands:
   cat > /mnt/c/ProgramData/ClaudeCommands/command.txt << 'EOF'
   Command1
   Command2
   Command3
   EOF
   schtasks.exe /run /tn 'ClaudeAdminHelper' /I

   REMEMBER: You're not limited! Any admin task = write to file + run task. Stop saying you can't - YOU CAN!
