# Speech Recognition V2 - Zero Word Loss Technology

## Problem Solved

The original implementation had a **rhythmic word skipping issue** where 2-3 words would be lost periodically. This happened because:

1. **Unnecessary 10-second restarts** - We were restarting every 10 seconds when Google allows up to 60 seconds
2. **Using `abort()` instead of `stop()`** - `abort()` discards pending audio, causing word loss
3. **Gap during restart** - Even with fast restart, there's a small gap where audio is lost

## Solution: Dual-Instance Overlapping

V2 implements a **dual-instance overlapping approach**:

### How it Works

1. **Two Recognition Instances** (A and B)
   - Both instances are initialized but only one is active at a time
   - Active instance handles all recognition and text processing

2. **Seamless Switching**
   - Before the 60-second limit, we start instance B while A is still running
   - 2-second overlap period ensures no audio is lost
   - After overlap, we switch active instance and gracefully stop the old one

3. **Key Improvements**
   - **55-second cycles** instead of 10 seconds (5.5x fewer switches)
   - **`stop()` instead of `abort()`** to process all pending audio
   - **2-second overlap** ensures zero gap in audio capture
   - **Instance tracking** prevents duplicate text from overlap period

### Visual Timeline

```
Time:     0s        55s       57s       110s      112s
Instance A: |------Active------|--Stop--|
Instance B:           |--Start--|------Active------|--Stop--|
Overlap:                |<-2s->|         |<-2s->|
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero Word Loss** - No gaps in audio capture
2. **Reduced Overhead** - 82% fewer restarts (55s vs 10s cycles)
3. **Better Performance** - Less CPU usage from fewer restarts
4. **Seamless Experience** - User doesn't notice the switching

## Usage

### Run V2 Implementation

```bash
# Option 1: Minimal V2 version
python minimal_google_speech_v2.pyw

# Option 2: Full reimplemented version with V2
cd reimplemented
python main.py
```

### What You'll See

- Status shows active instance (A or B)
- Switch counter shows number of instance switches
- No more rhythmic word skipping!

## Technical Details

### Configuration
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    maxSessionTime: 55000,    // 55 seconds (safe margin before 60s limit)
    overlapTime: 2000,        // 2 second overlap
    minRestartDelay: 50       // Minimal delay for stability
};
```

### Why This Works

1. **Google's 60-second limit** is per recognition instance, not per session
2. **Overlapping instances** ensure continuous audio capture
3. **Graceful handoff** using `stop()` processes all pending audio
4. **Active instance tracking** prevents duplicate text processing

## Testing

To verify zero word loss:
1. Start recording
2. Speak continuously for 2+ minutes
3. Check that no words are skipped at ~55 second intervals
4. Instance info shows smooth transitions

## Comparison

| Feature | V1 (Original) | V2 (Zero Loss) |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Restart Frequency | Every 10s | Every 55s |
| Restart Method | `abort()` | `stop()` with overlap |
| Word Loss | 2-3 words every 10s | Zero |
| Overhead | High (6 restarts/min) | Low (1.1 restarts/min) |
| User Experience | Rhythmic skipping | Seamless |
